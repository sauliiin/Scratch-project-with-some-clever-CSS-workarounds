# Scratch Project â€“ CSS Workarounds

This repository contains a website adapted from an experimental project.  
It features some interesting CSS tricks and creative workarounds.

The project is not very polished and includes a few bold (sometimes even poor) design choices and quirky color combinations â€” but thatâ€™s part of what I actually love about it.

Despite its rough edges, it serves as a constant source of inspiration. I often return to this codebase to revisit certain snippets and ideas whenever I need a spark of creativity.

## Highlights
- Clever CSS workarounds
- Bold and unconventional design choices
- A personal source of reference and inspiration

**PS:** This site is **not optimized for mobile** â€” and I donâ€™t plan to do it, since itâ€™s just a scratch project I revisit from time to time. ðŸ˜‰

**Note:** This was made like the Mayas and Incas â€” **without any help from ChatGPT.**
