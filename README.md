# Scratch Project – CSS Workarounds

This repository contains a website adapted from an experimental project.  
It features some interesting CSS tricks and creative workarounds.  

The project is not very polished and includes a few bold (sometimes even poor) design choices and quirky color combinations — but that’s part of what I actually love about it.  

Despite its rough edges, it serves as a constant source of inspiration. I often return to this codebase to revisit certain snippets and ideas whenever I need a spark of creativity.  

## Highlights
- Clever CSS workarounds
- Bold and unconventional design choices
- A personal source of reference and inspiration
